# Implementing the examples from Recommender Systems - The Textbook

This is my attempt at implementing the examples from "Recommenter Systems - The Textbook" by Charu C. Aggarwal using Python.

Data used is either coming from the Textbook itself or from the MovieLens dataset (available at https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).

I'm primarily doing this for educational purposes, which means that the code that you are seeing is not likely to be optimized for production use.

If you want to get your copy of the book, you can get it from https://www.amazon.com/Recommender-Systems-Textbook-Charu-Aggarwal-ebook/dp/B01DK3GZDY

Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions or questions ;-)
